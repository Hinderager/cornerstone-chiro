            Carpal tunnel is a condition that affects the nerves in your hands and arms. It is caused by pressure on the median nerve, which runs from your neck to your hand. This pressure can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in your arm and hand. Usually, this happens because the tendons in your wrist are too tight. Any issue that squeezes or potentially irritates the median nerve can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.

              <p className="text-[#58585A]">
                Doing the same thing over and over can cause the tendons in your wrist to become tight and compressed. This is common for those who do repetitive tasks for long periods.

              <p className="text-[#58585A]">
                Bad posture with your neck and shoulders can put pressure on the nerves in your neck, which can result in carpal tunnel syndrome.

              <p className="text-[#58585A]">
                Lifting weights can put extra pressure on the nerves in your arm and neck area, which can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.

              <p className="text-[#58585A]">
                During pregnancy, the body produces more of a hormone called relaxin. This hormone loosens the ligaments in your body to make room for the baby. However, it can also cause the tendons in your wrist to become too loose and compressed. In addition, natural pregnancy swelling can put additional pressure on your median nerve causing carpal tunnel.
